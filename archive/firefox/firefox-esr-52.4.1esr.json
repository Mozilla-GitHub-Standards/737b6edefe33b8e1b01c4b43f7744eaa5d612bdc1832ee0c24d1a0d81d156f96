                "nthomas: fallout from [Bug 1387622](https://bugzil.la/1387622). When we ship we'll need to manually adjust the [firefox-sha1 alias in bouncer](https://bounceradmin.mozilla.com/admin/mirror/productalias/12/) to point at 'Firefox-52.4.1esr-sha1'. This will be fixed in future releases. mbrandt may pop up on IRC if there is a delay in updating the alias, as he has a test suite that monitors it",
