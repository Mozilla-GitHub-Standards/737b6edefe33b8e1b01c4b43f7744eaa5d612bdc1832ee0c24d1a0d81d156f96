| Bug                                                           | Description                | Reported By         | For release |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| [bug 1488511](https://bugzil.la/1488511)  | Final verify failed  due to matching HTTP headers case-sensitively | tomprince  | Firefox 60.2.0esr |
| [bug 1488518](https://bugzil.la/1488518)  | Bouncer entries for completes point at bz2 paths. | tomprince  | Firefox 60.2.0esr |
| [bug 1488686](https://bugzil.la/1488686)  | 52.9.0esr -> 60.2.0esr: wrong bouncer entries found by final-verify => "firefox-60.2.0esr-complete-bz2" doesn't exist. Fixed manually. | jlorenzo  | Firefox 60.2.0esr |
| [bug 1488396](https://bugzil.la/1488396)  | Snap push failed. It timed out after uploading the snap. Resolved by manually promoting this snap to the candidate channel | jlorenzo  | Firefox 62.0rc |
| [bug 1486745](https://bugzil.la/1486745)  | release-secondary-final-verify-firefox failed to download some TC artifacts. The root cause is bug 1486582: it often returns a 500, which comes from the Queue not being able to resolve some DNS. The taskcluster team is on it. On our end, we could probably retry on the downloads. I don't see any retry on the logs. For instance: https://taskcluster-artifacts.net/Gaayh57cTlqURXqDvUwQRw/26/public/logs/live_backing.log  | jlorenzo  | Firefox 62.0rc |
| [bug 1486747](https://bugzil.la/1486747)  | "Firefox-62.0build1-Complete" in bouncer didn't have any location set. Bouncerscript should add them even when the product already exists. | jlorenzo  | Firefox 62.0rc |
| [bug 1486475](https://bugzil.la/1486475)  | releaserunner failed to mark build as started in shipit-v1, causing a second promote action to be created. This led to duplicate complete.mar entries in the balrog blob (as per Bug 1389312). | tomprince  | Thunderbird 60.0b11 |
