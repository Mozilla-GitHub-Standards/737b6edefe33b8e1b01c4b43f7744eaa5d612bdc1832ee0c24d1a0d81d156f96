#### Resolved issues
- jlorenzo - [bug 1466627](https://bugzil.la/1466627) - https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-beta/rev/5ba0247433fe didn't make the beta builds. Mark as ship will fail. We just need to use the ship-it web UI (the old one) to mark the release as shipped. Kudos to Mihai for warning us.
