| Bug                                                           | Description                | Reported By         | For release |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| [bug 1478997](https://bugzil.la/1478997)  | treescript.exceptions.ChangesetMismatchError: Expected 2 changesets to push, found 1 | jlorenzo  | Firefox 62.0b12 |
| [bug 1478935](https://bugzil.la/1478935)  | Instead of kicking off the push graph for devedition 62.0b12, the ship one was started https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-beta&revision=23bc64507f53b0cba44c72f72539716adcf02d68&selectedJob=190452585. This leaves devedition in a state where we let new users install b12, but updates are still on hold for existing users - until QE greenlights the build. :jcristau from relman was okay to let devedition in this state and just sign off balrog when the build is done | jlorenzo  | Devedition 62.0b12 |
| [bug 1470232](https://bugzil.la/1470232)  | Firefox failed to tag release, due to verification and devedition already having bumped version. | tomprince  | Firefox 62.0b13 |
