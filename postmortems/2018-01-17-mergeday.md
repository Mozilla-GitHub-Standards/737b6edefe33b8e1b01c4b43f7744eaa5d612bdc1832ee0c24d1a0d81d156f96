| ------- | -------------------------- |
| [(RW Issue 47)](https://github.com/mozilla-releng/releasewarrior-2.0/issues/47) | Releasewarrior docs confusing, in part due to early devedition being normal. |
| [1430202](https://bugzil.la/1430202) | Needed to manually patch mozharness to not push version bump to central (shouldn't need to manually patch) |
| [1430206](https://bugzil.la/1430206) | Mozharness should be smarter about disk utilization for merge day. |
| None Yet | Version bump task for 58 beta would have run after merge day |

| None yet | hg replication times out while pushing. |
| None yet | l10n bumper should be able to be run without pushing as DONTBUILD |

## Fixed Issues

| Bug     | Description                |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| [1412962#c2](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412962#c2) | Needed to manually patch mozharness to not push version bump to central |
| None | Callek confused about how to login to remote mergeday instance (future threat of this tracked in issue 47) |
| None | Merge day instance space concerns (callek just used sfrasers directory) |
| None | Merge from m-c to beta happened before last cycles betas finished. Manually had to cancel the version bump task for 58beta16 |
| [1412967](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412967#c10) | Callek missed landing a required puppet patch to support new releaserunner regex's, despite a poke from :mihai. This should have been tracked better (as part of merge) instead of just prereq. |
| [1412962#c16](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412962#c16) | m-b=>m-r merge failed due to branding in l10n-nightly mozconfig, not sure how it didn't fail on cen=>beta merge day for last cycle. Fixed with patch |
| [1412962#c16](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1412962) | buildbot-config gecko patch was confused because of early merge being new normal |
| None | [prevent_ftl_changes](https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools/file/ec49538a6fb5/hghooks/mozhghooks/check/prevent_ftl_changes.py) hook prevented m-b=>m-r merge due to a .ftl file being modified during the push. :fubar tried to disable but the .name was different than the filename, so was delayed until :gps started his day. Manually disabled the hook for the push and re-enabled after it was done. |
| None | Callek misread a 'no changes' from the --commit-changes step of the merge day script as being from the push after a replication failure on a push. Resulting in :callek saying the m-c=>m-b merge was done. This was resolved by a repush |
| [1430044](https://bugzil.la/1430044) | Callek missed doing a manual l10n-bump after merge due to the state of merge docs. The auto bumps didn't happen due to closed beta tree. Additionally impacted by the manual bump pushing with DONTBUILD |
