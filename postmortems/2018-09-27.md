## Releases which had issues

### Release: Firefox 63.0b8 2018-09-20

#### Resolved issues
- asasaki - [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none) - prematurely shipped fx 63.0b8. cancelled ship graph; need to run `tc-filter.py --graph-id GT-f8ebSRomsoC9k2ZQHUA --state exception --action rerun` to ship
- nthomas - [bug 1493056](https://bugzil.la/1493056) - Partner repackage jobs fail to download upstream artifact, and try to chmod a mar util we don't need. We re-enable partner & EME-free at b8 and determined with RyanVM we wouldn't block shipping on this. To force promote to continue we used 'taskluster task rerun' on release-generate-checksums (ZUNzA7VNQMyGIfb6ujoCgA)
- nthomas - [bug 1493053](https://bugzil.la/1493053) - release-snap-push-firefox needs xdelta3 tool
